# P.I.A.N.O PCB Repository
This repository currently contains all the KiCad files for the P.I.A.N.O PCB.    

To clone this repository, please run:   
```
git clone https://github.com/jaredbotte/PIANO-PCB.git
cd PIANO-PCB
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

This will ensure that you have all the required parts libraries to view our PCB.

I tried my best to ensure that all paths are relative, but if a path cannot be found, please try looking in the "manage libraries" or "manage footprints" tabs.

TODO: Prune this and include minimal files from external repositories!
